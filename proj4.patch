-
-This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
-published from being rewound.
-
-The workflow assumed here is:
-
- * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
-   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
-
- * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
-   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
-   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
-   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
-   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
-
- * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
-   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
-
-The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
-to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
-$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
-
-With this workflow, you would want to know:
-
-(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
-    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
-    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
-    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
-    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
-    not want to rewind it.
-
-(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
-    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
-    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
-    change things related to the topic as patches against your
-    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
-    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
-    tip of "master".
-
-Let's look at this example:
-
-		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
-		  /       /           /           /
-		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
-		/   /               /           /
-	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
-	      /   /   /             \         /
-	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
-	    /   /   /   /             \     /
-    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
-
-
-A, B and C are topic branches.
-
- * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
-
- * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
-   and is ready to be deleted.
-
- * C has not merged to "next" at all.
-
-We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
-B to be deleted.
-
-To compute (1):
-
-	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
-	git rev-list ^master        next
-
-	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
-
-To compute (2):
-
-	git rev-list master..topic
-
-	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

+xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
+Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
+but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.
 
+ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
+
+xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
+to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
+2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/v6.html, which
+provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.
+
+xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
+    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
+    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
+    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
+    NetBSD (console.c)
+
+The following people have made contributions:
+    Russ Cox (context switching, locking)
+    Cliff Frey (MP)
+    Xiao Yu (MP)
+    Nickolai Zeldovich
+    Austin Clements
+
+In addition, we are grateful for the bug reports and patches contributed by
+Silas Boyd-Wickizer, Peter Froehlich, Shivam Handa, Anders Kaseorg, Eddie
+Kohler, Yandong Mao, Hitoshi Mitake, Carmi Merimovich, Joel Nider, Greg Price,
+Eldar Sehayek, Yongming Shen, Stephen Tu, and Zouchangwei.
+
+The code in the files that constitute xv6 is
+Copyright 2006-2014 Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, and Russ Cox.
+
+ERROR REPORTS
+
+If you spot errors or have suggestions for improvement, please send
+email to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris (kaashoek,rtm@csail.mit.edu). 
+
+BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6
+
+To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run "make".
+On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will
+need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF
+binaries.  See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/tools.html.
+Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-".
+
+To run xv6, install the QEMU PC simulators.  To run in QEMU, run "make qemu".
+
+To create a typeset version of the code, run "make xv6.pdf".  This
+requires the "mpage" utility.  See http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage/.
